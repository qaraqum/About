## Cover letter
Shalom!

I am Mikhail. I moved to Israel from Russia at the end of 2022, graduated from ulpan bet, worked here as a marketing manager in Help People Group (volunteer fund).

Before that I got a degree in software development, worked as a web developer 
and project manager for 4 years. After that I got interested in the real economy 
and worked my way through almost every department of a manufacturing 
group of companies, ending up as its CBDO.

After relocating, I decided to go back to what I loved more - software and quality assurance. And since I haven't coded for production for a long time, I finished 
my QA tester course and I feel it's mine.

I've always enjoyed creating new things that meet high quality standards and meet 
the customer's wishes. I have relevant experience and I am very interested in it.

Now I want to become a valuable part of the development team, to communicate, succeed and grow together.

Thank you for reading it.
I look forward to receiving feedback.
